            <strong>Public libraries can be so much more</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            Schools don’t always foster trust and respect. Trust and respect is essential for student self esteem, growth, and wellbeing.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Libraries and bookstores, hereafter L&Bs, can fill that gap as afterschool programs and as welcoming, safe afterschool spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
            If schools are funnels—students go from class to class on a bell schedule, sit in assigned seats, try not to make noise—L&Bs are spaces.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> They are exploratory, unconstrained. They send clear signals of trust and respect: walk in (anyone!), wander, take books off the shelves, read them.
            </p>
            <p>
            In fifth grade I had math team practice at 4:30 every Thursday.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> School ended at 3:00. With nowhere to go, my two best friends and I would walk over to the town library and hang out. The library had two wings, a kids wing with a mini indoor treehouse and rows and rows of kids books, and an adult section with grown up books, wooden chairs (rather than bean bag chairs), and a special room that served baked goods every Thursday. Clearly, math team chose the right day to practice.
            </p>
            <p>
            We weren’t the only kids blitzing out of class for pastries, but even though we all ran to the library, none of us ran once we were in the library. We were still very giggly, but too giggly. Pastries in hand, we read books—or played video games on the library computers when we could get away with it.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am extremely thankful that we had a welcoming space to be after school. There is not enough academic writing on libraries as community spaces, but the consensus is that time spent in libraries has positive academic and social impacts on kids.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> If I was the Librarian of Congress, I would push to expand libraries—especially in low income areas—to create safe, exploratory spaces for kids after school.

            Not all kids gravitate towards books, but who said anyone had to read? L&Bs can be spaces for art, board and card games, quiet giggling, telescope-gazing, and anything else a library has funding to create. Here comes our second issue: libraries are underfunded and bookstores are losing revenues to Amazon. Neither can fit a whole school’s worth of kids in them.<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> 
            </p>
            <p>
            Libraries are underfunded because in policy conversations, they are often seen as book repositories, not community spaces. That’s a hard sell. They’re also not large recipients of philanthropy, with the nation’s 9,000+ libraries receiving a total of $2.9 billion from 2006 to 2017, averaging less than $30,000 per library each year.<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> We have a Catch 22: libraries don’t have enough funding to make a meaningful community impact, but to get funding, they need to show they can make a meaningful community impact.
            </p>
            <p>
            Convincing policymakers is hard because L&Bs don’t exactly have lobbying power. Convincing philanthropists is easier—prove this works, and prove it big—but fraught. Part of the reason libraries rarely solicit philanthropy is because they’re worried it will prompt the government to decrease funding. To that end, philanthropy would have to be both continuous (not one-time… I’m looking at you, Carnegie) and comprehensive, which comes with its own problems: “public” libraries funded by a select few stop being so public, and controlled by voters. To avoid these complications, bookstores should seek philanthropy and libraries should lobby politicians.

            Both groups will need data: an experiment at a small scale paired with a longitudinal study on student academic success and esteem. 
            </p>
            <ol>
            
            <li>Select libraries and bookstores in small, low income communities. Open new bookstores if needed.
            
            <li>Provide a budget for a few afterschool programs, some structured—painting, book groups, librarian tutoring—some unstructured, preferably with pastries.
            
            <li>Measure student success through attendance rates for the years prior to, during, and following the program. If the program is targeted at high schools, look at SAT participation rates.
            
            <li>Measure student esteem through personal surveys and librarian feedback, or design a metric like <a href="https://www.blog.benguzovsky.com/spark">vulnerability instances</a>. 
            
            <li>Compare student outcomes to students at other similar school districts.
            </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            L&Bs present an untapped opportunity for students to learn and grow in an environment different from school, sport, and home, but one with greater trust, respect, and room for exploration. Let’s tap this opportunity.

                 L&Bs have an asset they severely underutilize: space. During down hours, L&Bs are empty or near-empty. Down hours often overlap with afterschool time: 3-5pm. That means today, without any further study, there are opportunities for afterschool programs at libraries at little to no cost to either (depending on whether there is already easy transportation).&nbsp;<a href="#fnref5" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a><li id="fn6">
