            <strong>Potential for rapid education reform</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            There are patterns in education systems. Across classrooms, school districts, and state lines, schools are missing the same opportunities to improve student self esteem and success. Unlike many policymakers and advocates, I do not believe these opportunities are large. Classrooms should not be turned upside down. There is no one-size-fits all policy or game-changing teaching method that will improve American education.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
            These opportunities are narrow. Based on my experiences, research, and long conversations with students, I think there are small, widespread habits and practices that have negative impacts across the board. Importantly, if these habits and practices exist, they can be changed much more easily than overhauling the entire system. I am not a billionaire or a lobbyist, and can’t shift the national policy conversation.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> I can produce concrete evidence for small, non-controversial changes that will have nationwide benefits for students. I want to sit in on middle and high school classes across the country to discover patterns, identifying which have scalable solutions. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I spent half my time in school staring out a window until I realized my experience as an unhappy student might be useful. I realized that, maybe, if I think critically about how my teachers teach, how my peers listened and learned—or why they didn’t—maybe I could have an impact on the next group of students’ experiences. I’m on a year off from Princeton that concludes in February, and I am thrilled to say this project will be my sole priority until then. I am pursuing this project without preconceptions on what these patterns and opportunities are, or a theory I want to prove. I will look most closely at three areas:
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Trust</strong>. Trust and respect is essential for a student’s esteem—and their success. In many NYC schools, students have to walk through metal detectors every day. That’s no environment for learning. Not every school has metal detectors, but every school has practices that make students feel less safe, engaged, and heard. One of my friends in high school would interrupt teachers when he felt something wasn’t fair. They responded in kind. Saying he was the problem would be easy: there’s a consistent trend of behavior across classes. But why would this clear-headed, smart guy keep interrupting, getting harshly punished every time? Education reform can’t solve his 5:30am wake up to get to school on time or that after sports practice, he’d only be home at 7pm. It can control what happens in the classroom.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Maybe he only interrupted in classes where he didn’t have space to voice frustration. I went to a nice suburban public school, and this is one of dozens of examples I witnessed. Are there universal trust gaps that can be addressed across school systems?—Metal detectors are hard to remove, but in half of my friend’s classes, he never interrupted: is there a generalizable pattern in the classroom environments where he didn’t feel the need to lash out?
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Coordination</strong>. Parents, school boards, teachers, unions, and administrators. I don’t have solutions on whether gifted programs are good or bad, and I don’t think there is a universal answer, but I think communication between these groups is often broken—making progress towards a compromise slower. Is coordination broken in the same ways in different types of schools? In different states? Are there unilateral changes that could clarify the process? If not, can we make a judgment call on a narrow, near-unilateral change?—Say parents can’t get transparent answers on how a gifted program will impact the resources left for other students and all parties except the school board want greater transparency: is there a way to leverage existing regulation to enforce transparency? Is there a way to do this at scale for schools with related issues?
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Curriculum</strong>. The simple question, “Who writes your textbooks and curricula, and who chooses these writers?” is extremely hard to answer. Even a hands-on, nationwide survey asking this question alone in personal, frank conversations would be extremely valuable. There are micro-level improvements to make here like understanding the way India’s caste system is discussed in history classes.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Macro-level I will look for larger patterns: are students fed information, or are they given opportunities to question it? Does the curriculum hint at an understanding of skills it is teaching?—For example, an English teacher assigning short personal essays about religion, identity, family, and community every week is likely very aware they are helping students think critically about who they are. Great. Is there a universal issue where other English teachers give no opportunities for personal writing? I hope to find evidence that patterns like that exist and if they do, whether they can negatively impact students. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Generally, designing good curricula is hard because getting student feedback on course design is near impossible, as is measuring student success. Trust and respect is equally hard to measure, and nobody wants to be disrespectful or disrespected: telling teachers to “be more respectful” sounds a bit silly. Coordination changes—especially if one group is opposed to them—will require concrete, measurable evidence as well. A nationwide study could solve this problem by comparison: finding national patterns, shadowing a teacher or student’s full day to find class-to-class differences, asking teachers to make changes mid-class, talking to current and former students, teachers and administrators, and a true measurable approach.
            </p>
            <p>
            I don’t know if the best metric will be counting instances of asking for help, the number of times a teacher/student feels disrespected, judging frequency of teacher-student eye contact, looking at student posture changes, how many times they check phones—or another quieter detail I’ll only discovere when I’m in classes. I’ll measure concrete signals of a trust, interest, or curiosity gap, then make them concrete with inter and intra school comparisons, even watching changes during a class. Much of my work will be emotional, better defined qualitatively, but I will also need defined, standardized measurements like these.<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> 
            </p>
            <p>
            I will be quiet. I will dress in neutral colors. I will try to make a minimal impact on classes I visit. I’m not sure what I’ll find, but I know that as long as there are students who don’t have their emotional, social, and educational needs met in American classrooms, projects like this one are essential.

            <p>
                 Even if I could, I think this is a fraught, inefficient approach. The trickle down from federal to state to district to school board to administrators to teachers is convoluted, incentives are broadly misaligned, and at each step of the process there are competing forces: unions, parents, advocacy groups, and lobbies of every shape and intent.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a><li id="fn3">

                 While the person writing chemistry textbooks is (usually) a chemist, the “historian” writing your history textbook may misinterpret the sources they’re using. Most importantly, they get to pick and choose what goes in the textbook and how it’s written. One world history textbook may talk about India’s caste system as an arbitrary line drawn between social classes; another might frame it as an oppressive system that standardized and enforced class inequality. Another so-called world history textbook may not mention caste at all and focus only on European history. If we read a textbook closely and understand the decisions the author is making, we can rely on it. However, just as the author could have made objectively or subjectively incorrect conclusions about the sources he read, we may fall into the same traps reading their textbook. Today, discriminating against someone based on their caste is clearly unacceptable, but how do we reckon with the system’s history? Were any of us thinking this in sixth grade history class, or did we skim over that textbook page? As a result, the history textbook writer, a student reading it, another student reading it with less skepticism, and a layman who has never read any history textbook all have disjoint understandings of the past.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref4" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a><li id="fn5">
            <p>
                 This won’t subvert the issue of measurable impacts seeming vague at scale. Even if at scale, something is clearly flawed (data showing gifted programs may bias teachers in favor of gifted students, neglecting equally capable “non-gifted ones”) those impacts may not translate back to individual classrooms (some teachers are confident in their ability to correct this bias, and they may very well be right. The emotional impact of a report like this becomes so crucial here, because it will be far more persuasive than any data can be.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref5" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
