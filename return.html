        <p>Google Search sucks, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30347719">everybody’s talking about it</a>. It’s not the only search engine that has delivered increasingly disappointing results. Google Scholar, Proquest, WorldCat, any academic search engine—terrible, imprecise ways of finding existing knowledge. And the news—oh, the news!—everyone has a bone to pick with the news. </p>
        <p>Many <a href="https://www.you.com">startups</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23000352/instagram-algorithm-reels-video-following-favorites">companies</a> have tried to address these frustrations with <em>content curation</em>: giving you content that’s vetted for <a href="https://thebrowser.com/">interesting-ness</a> and/or <a href="https://tweetedtimes.com/">personally tailored</a>.<a href=#fn1><sup>1</sup></a> Some do this <a href="https://beta.startupy.world/">manually</a>, but most have an algorithmic component. Others have tried to innovate search itself, giving you <a href="yext.com">text-based answers</a> rather than links. Overall, these approaches haven’t yet panned out.<a href=#fn2><sup>2</sup></a> </p>
        <p>Most of us prefer a friend’s recipe recommendation to Google’s. We have shared trust with friends, and value their recommendation.<a href=#fn3><sup>3</sup></a> You have to try a Google recipe, where your friend has <em>already</em> tried their recipe. And you trust their taste. Google attempts to replicate that trust by showing good results, but it can’t quite match a friend’s experience. We tolerate Google for recipes—even the oh so long scroll to the bottom of a recipe page—because it is convenient. But.</p>
        <p>If you want more than basic facts, decent pancakes, or a readable article on a Sunday afternoon, no search engine or content curation will beat talking to an expert. We share trust with experts in a very similar way we do friends. What if you had access to a famous chef’s recipe recommendation?—not the spammy online content they put out to butter their own brand, but an actually amazing chef’s actual favorite recipe. Proven expertise is a powerful way to build trust, especially for academic subjects, but for food, quality articles, health information, and anything you want to know, really. </p>
        <p>Princeton has a great academic solution for their students: subject librarians. For every major, there is a full time librarian—usually with a PhD in the field—whose main job is answering student questions and connecting them with resources. These librarians are incredibly insightful and always a short email away. They’re experts at navigating their field’s often convoluted web of knowledge. They’ll steer you clear of common pitfalls like a mentor would.</p>
        <p>The New York Public Library has an even better offer: a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfqgDG1qrKg">Human Google</a>.” Call the <a href="https://www.nypl.org/get-help/contact-us">Ask NYPL</a> number with any question and a librarian will try their best to answer. Medical sources of truth—<a href="http://uptodate.com">paid</a> and <a href="http://onefact.org">free</a>—have proved essential for doctors looking for up to date information and patients tired of <a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/ss/slideshow-essential-oils">sensationalist WebMD pages</a>. Many online “communities,” <a href="http://linen.dev">Slack and Discord</a> groups of like-minded people, try to bridge Google’s trust gap as well (very lucratively), and expert insight on their own are <a href="https://www.tegus.com/">even more monetizable</a>.</p>
 
        <p style="text-align: center;">—</p>

        <p>I think these solutions are scalable. In fact, I think every platform I’ve linked here has ambitions of becoming <em>the</em> source of trustworthy, accessible answers online (no, not the NYPL, you what-about-er). I don’t think they’ll succeed because at scale, most of them lose trust: a small community is valuable because it is small. The only way of maintaining shared trust is to scale expertise. If these platforms succeed, or if a new player enters the market and succeeds, I think they’ll take an approach that looks something like this:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Pay a bunch of handpicked experts in a field to take phone calls and emails. Pay them well. Pay them I-just-raised-a-Series-A-from-Sequoia well. </li>
        <li>Talk about your expert phone line in relevant online communities, run ads on Google for common searches in the field you know have bad results, and buy a billboard in San Francisco proper. Make sure your experts keep track of interesting questions and answers. </li>
        <li>Send out a weekly newsletter with these tidbits, and with article recommendations from your experts—they’re reading relevant articles anyway. </li>
        <li>Save all the tidbits in an online library: today, we append “reddit” to the end of searches to find more human discussions; tomorrow we’ll have a deeper, reddit-like well of knowledge on your platform. </li>
        <li>Combine the best bits of all your competitors—text-based answers, signals of trust, personal tailoring, and a hint of some AI/ML-ish buzzwords—into a searchable library.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Expand to another subfield, then another one. Start on college campuses, maybe. Or hire real librarians with too much free time at work. </p>
        <p>Don’t run ads, ever. Ideally this is a nonprofit bankrolled by your friendly neighborhood billionaire, but if you have to, put a price tag on it. Even more ideally, the price tag is only on information for non-sensitive topics (asking an English professor about the history of talking animals in literature is paid, high quality medical advice is free).</p>
        <p>Convince your investors that you need funding for acquisitions. Acquire a couple of these other curation companies. If you still have VCs, now is the time to cut them out: they’ll want to make money, you want to help people. Those incentives won’t align, and hey, you’re already pretty darn rich by this point.<a href=#fn4><sup>4</sup></a> </p>
        <p>Invest in building and expanding physical libraries, and in hiring more librarians—pay them more, too. Pay new librarians to become experts in topics where you’re understaffed. </p>
        <p>Use these expanded libraries as <a href="https://blog.benguzovsky.com/moretrust">spaces for kids to learn</a>. Secure government subsidy for this, probably.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">—</p>
        <p>Excluding climate change, homelessness, and other existential crises, I think democratizing knowledge is the most important thing we can do. This is a shift that won’t happen naturally, and requires large amounts of capital. </p>
        <p>This starts on a very small scale. So: my phone is 415-nine hundred-4662.<a href=#fn5><sup>5</sup></a> My email is <a href="mailto:benjamin.guzovsky+librarian@gmail.com">benjamin.guzovsky+librarian@gmail.com</a>. Though I’m not an expert expert, <a href="benguzovsky.com">here’s why you should trust me</a> with questions on writing (especially writing!), swimming (ask about technique or training regiments—send me a video of you swimming!), Russian recipes (yes, I will share my grandmother’s), and article recommendations. All other questions are welcome, and opinions are my own. All answers are free, and always will be. You may request the conversation not be saved or documented in any way. I am NOT a financial advisor. </p>
        <p>If you are an expert expert who wants to try this, reach out.</p>

             Another missed opportunity here that I’m working on is gaming Google for good. Where AI-generated gibberish has hurt Google results, <a href="https://www.blog.benguzovsky.com/spark">carefully designed content can outcompete it</a>.</p>

             This is hard to actually measure, but most companies in the space that I follow have not posted exceptional results, and some *cough* Yext *cough* are well underperforming.
